                <li> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li> 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li> 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
                <li> 1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
                <li> Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            </ul></p>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p><ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li> Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package
                        instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li> In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian
                        sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped
                        onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion
                        becomes translucent.</li>
                    <li> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato
                        sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black
                        pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook
                        for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld
                        together.</li>
                    <li> In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and
                        beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
                    <li> To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the
                        meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                        Place 3 lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping.
                        Spread about half of the ricotta mixture evenly over the
                        noodles. Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella and Parmesan
                        cheese on top. Repeat these layers, ending with a final
                        layer of meat sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella
                        and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
                    <li> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in
                        the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil
                        and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the
                        cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <li> Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a
                        few minutes. Sprinkle chopped parsley on top for
                        garnish.</li>
                    <li> Slice and serve the lasagna while it's still warm. It
                        pairs well with a side salad or garlic bread.</li>
                    <li> Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
